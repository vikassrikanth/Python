Project Using scikit-learn, we modeled on Airbnb dataset to estimate prices of Airbnb listings for the guests depending on various features like neighborhood, zipcodes, apartment type etc.

The Jupyter notebook in this repo contains the code to run Exploratory Data Analysis and Regression estimators on the Inside Airbnb listings dataset for Denver.

The target variable is the price of the listing.

Using this dataset I tried to answer some of the questions like:

- What are the most important characteristics of a listings in Denver, and how do they influence the price?
- Which neighborhoods in Denver have the highest rental prices?
- What distinguishes hosts that have Superhost status? Do all Superhosts properly qualify the criteria that AirBnB has set for them?
- Does reducing the dimensionality of the dataset lead to loss in information?
